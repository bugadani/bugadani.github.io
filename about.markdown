# About me

Hi! I'm Daniel Buga, a Hungarian electrical engineer based in Budapest. I tend to get lost in irrelevant details while missing the obvious.

Find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/bugadani), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/dbuga.bsky.social/) or sometimes [Twix](https://x.com/bugadani).
