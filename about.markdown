# About me

Hi! I'm Daniel Buga, a Hungarian electrical engineer based in Budapest. Former embedded software
developer at Revolution Robotics. I tend to get lost in irrelevant details while missing the obvious.

Find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/bugadani), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bugadani) or
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-buga/).
